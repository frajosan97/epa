                                The Economic Patriotic Alliance (EPA) is at the forefront of advocating for social democracy in Kenya,
                                focusing on equitable governance and sustainable development. Our mission is to ensure that economic
                                growth positively impacts all citizens, addressing key issues such as inequality and unemployment.

                                Founded to tackle critical socio-economic issues in Kenya, the EPA emerged from the collective vision
                                of community leaders and activists. Our establishment was driven by the desire to create an inclusive
                                society where everyone can thrive.
                            </p>

                                The EPA has proudly served a diverse range of clients, including local communities, advocacy groups,
                                and policy makers. We work collaboratively to ensure that their voices are heard and that their needs
                                are prioritized in economic discussions.
